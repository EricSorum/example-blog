# FreeSlate Template

## Why FreeSlate?

Because FreeSlate builds with code thatâ€™s free.  FreeSlate offers simplicity and affordability alongside limitless future potential.  When you build with this tech, you will have code that will belong to you and can be endlessly customized..

While content management systems like WordPress and site builders like Wix continue to serve many people's needs, these options have serious drawbacks.  While they seem low-cost, there are many small fees along the way that add up, and while they are quick to set up, the future is full of uncertainty.

## Why Not WordPress

WordPress
Tethers you to outdated PHP tech with risks to performance and security
Miscellaneous fees for plugins, with compatibility issues threatening stability
Uncertain future for maintenance costs.

Why Not Use a Site Builder?
If you need to get a simple site up, using a builder may be quick and convenient.  But once you build a website with one of these companies, your website cannot be transferred to any other system.  Improvements are limited, and the future is at the mercy of changes to the company.

Wix
Subscription fee increases by adding features
Limited customization in affordable tiers
Proprietary code limits integration with other tools

SquareSpace
A high cost for for limited features
Built on rigid templates
Advanced customization requires coding knowledge without allowing full control

Weebly
Few updates since being acquired by Square
Limited potential for unique branding and style


The FreeSlate website template was created by Eric Sorum out of a desire to offer the latest advancements in development to everyone who wants a website.  

As a developer, Eric loves working with React.js and TypeScript, and choosing tools built on these was a natural choice.  By adding Next.js for the backend and Tailwind for style, FreeSlate is built on modern standards of development.  FreeSlate brings these together with Payload CMS to allow for the most modern and reliable practices.  The entire codebase is owned by you and in control by your developer.
