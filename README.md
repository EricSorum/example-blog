## Why FreeSlate?
Because FreeSlate builds with code that’s free - free to use and free from limitations.  FreeSlate offers simplicity and affordability alongside limitless future potential.  When you build with this tech, you will have code that will belong to you and can be endlessly used and customized.

While content management systems like WordPress and site builders like Wix continue to serve many people's needs, these options have serious drawbacks.  While they seem low-cost, there are many small fees along the way that add up, and while they are quick to set up, the future is full of uncertainty.

## Why Not WordPress
WordPress is an easy and affordable way to start a site, but the future is less certain.  Improving your site requires paying for better hosting and fees for numerous plugins that quickly add up.  You also find yourself tethered to outdated PHP tech with risks to performance and security, and an uncertain future for maintenance costs. 

## Why Not Use a Site Builder?
If you need to get a simple site up, using a builder may be quick and convenient.  But once you build a website with one of these companies, your website cannot be transferred to any other system.  You can't customize most of the code directly, or even see what's going.  Improving key areas like SEO, accessibility, and analytics require additional fees, and the future is in the hands of the company's business decisions.

### Wix
• Subscription fee increases with each feature you need
• Almost no customizations without subscribing to a high-cost tier
• Proprietary code limits integration with other tools

### SquareSpace
• A high cost for limited features
• Built on rigid templates
• Advanced customization requires coding knowledge without allowing full control

### Weebly
• Few updates since being acquired by Square
• Limited potential for unique branding and style
• Impossible to upgrade to a better server or CDN

## Build for the Future
The FreeSlate blog template was created by Eric Sorum out of a desire to offer the latest advancements in development to everyone who wants a website.  

As a developer, Eric loves working with React.js and TypeScript, and choosing tools built on these was a natural choice.  By adding Next.js for the backend and Tailwind for style, FreeSlate is built on modern standards of development.  FreeSlate brings these together with Payload CMS to build a blog site using the most modern and reliable practices.  The entire codebase is owned by you and can be engineered by anyone familiar with today's web tech.
